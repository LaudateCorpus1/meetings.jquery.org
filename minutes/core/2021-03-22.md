## Issues and PRs needing review
* https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/4863 
	- we discussed this at length. documentElement is not always an absolute positioning context. In the issue example, setting position: relative on html pushes down the select dropdown.

## Milestones
* 3.6.1: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/milestone/24
	- we have 5 issues now for 3.6.1. I'd like to get this out soon for bootstrap.
* 4.0: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/milestone/7
	- Please take some time to double-check which should be blockers (i.e. which you don't want pushed to a 4.1 or 5.0).
